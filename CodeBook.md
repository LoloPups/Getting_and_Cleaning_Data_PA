The first of results table is generated by the function **createResultTable**.
The steps below describe the steps of this function:

1. First of all script reads activities labels into the table **activityLabels** from the file *activity_labels.txt*
2. After this script reads all of features labels into the table **featureLabels** from the file *features.txt*
3. The training data and the test data are processed by the same function createTable:
  For simplicity it is possible to describe only the steps for merging training data:
  - Script reads **X_table** from the file *train\\X_train.txt* and renames column names in 
  accordance with featureLabels
  - As it is necessary to extract only the measurements with the mean and standard deviation,
  script creates the booleans list for features labels which names contains "mean" or "std".
  List is saved to variable **includedCols**.
  - Using **includedCols** script removes unnecessary columns from **X_table**.
  - The data with types of activities is read from the file *train\\y_train.txt* to the table **Y_table**.
  - Thee Name of a single **Y_table** column is renamed to "activity".
  - Using **activityLabels** script renames the activities in the **Y_table**. 
  - Subjects IDs are read from the file *train\\subject_train.txt* into table **subject** and 
  column of **subject** is renamed to "subject".
  - **subject**,**X_table**,**Y_table** are merged into result table
4. The merged training data are saved to **trainTable**, the merged test data are saved into **testTable**.
5. Both tables are bound into result table

The result of the function **createResultTable** is saved into table **resultData**
The second table **resultGroupedData** is result of aggregating data from **createResultTable** by 'subject' and 'activity' columns.
