The both tables are generated by the script "run_analysis.R"
This script contains two function: **createTable** for generating table from the training or test data and
**createResultTable** for generating the merged table.

The script calls function **createResultTable** and saves the result table to varaible **resultData**.
The second table is obtained by using function **aggreagete** for **resultData** and is saved to variable
**resultGroupedData**.

All of steps are described in file "CodeBook.md".
